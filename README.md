# Algorithm 101
Here I try to list a number of popular algorithms starting with Sorting algos 

The program uses a plugin architecture, so that anyone can write an algorithm and easily integret it to the system.

To run the program:
>python main.py filename --sort_type algorithm name

>python3 main.py filename --sort_type algorithm name

A sorted file will be placed with the sorted numbers in the sorted folder. The numbers should be placed  in the data\ folder in txt format
