# Algorithm 101
Here I try to list a number of popular algorithms starting with Sorting algos. Currently there is 3 sorting algirithm intregreted with the program and all of them sort in ascending order. These are- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort. More is on the way... 

The program uses a plugin architecture, so that anyone can write an algorithm and easily integret it to the system.

To run the program:
>python main.py filename --sort_type algorithm name

>python3 main.py filename --sort_type algorithm name

>Current algorithm name as in program:
    - insertionSort
    - mergeSort
    - quickSort

A sorted file will be placed with the sorted numbers in the sorted folder. The numbers should be placed  in the data\ folder in txt format
